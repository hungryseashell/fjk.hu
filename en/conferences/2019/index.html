                <p>I was born in Marosvásárhely in 1966. I specialised in chemistry-biology in secondary school. I graduated at the Faculty of Pharmacy of the University of Medicine in Kolozsvár.

I also participated in a course and a clinical practice based on lifestyle therapy at the Weimar Institution. I have been the national leader of the Department of Health Services in the Seventh-day Adventist Church since 1994, and lecturer at the Adventist Theology College since 1999. I teach Bioethics on the Lifestyle and Pastoral Counselling specialised training, and also teach subjects like Bible &amp; Health, and Christian Lifestyle.

Since 2008, I have been president of the Duna Conference of the Hungarian Union.<br>I continued my studies at Newbold College and the University Of Wales (UWTSD) in the field of theology and management science.

He is now retired, but his enthusiasm for God’s work hasn’t waned. He gets numerous invitations as a presenter from churches and lifestyle clubs in Czech Republic,  Slovakia and other countries. He has also been to Miskolc, Hungary, where he had a great impact on the brothers and sisters living there.<br>„From my childhood I am desiring to be missionary and to help poor people abroad where there is nobody but only Jesus with me to go forward and to proclaim Everlasting Gospel and to preach Three Angels message. Banana project came to my mind on prayer. It is God&#39;s project and is very successful. All children young and adult are receiving great blessing from bananas, physically and spiritually as well. Their strength is improving, their ability to study is increasing. Banana is good source of vitamins and minerals. I see great blessing for children when they are receiving regularly minimum one bananas per day. Their health condition is much improved when they are accepting minimum one banana per day and during short period of time you can see difference and His appearance and in his health condition. I am very thankful to our Lord who gave this idea of feeding slum children with bananas and I see it is very good source of very nutritional elements which small children need so much.”<br>You will hear more from the Banana-project on the Conference. :)</p>

                <h3>Reunion in light of a study</h3><span>Ernő Ősz-Farkas</span>
              </div>
              <div class="description">
                <p>
<p>Splits, dissensions and conflicts have always been part of christian history. Many research has been
made on why these splits happen, but we can hardly find studies about reunion and reconciliation in
the Seventh Day Adventist Church. The Hungarian Union Conference had a unique experience in
2015, when after 40 years, 700 people rejoined the world-wide family of the Seventh Day Adventist
Church.</p>

<p>The researcher (in the issue of a theological dissertation) investigated the motivation of reunion,
comparing them to the already existing studies on culture-change, involving 3 major groups.</p>

<p>During the 4 seminar session we will discuss the following questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How can the hungarian experience give a positive example for the church in resolving virtual
splits?</li>
  <li>How can a better understanding of the psychology of the reunion help us to disperse
concerns, experience integration and increase the efficiency of leadership support?</li>
  <li>How can the understanding and awareness of the stages of change help us to overcome
changes in other aspects of life?</li>
</ul>

<br>

<p>The seminars:</p>

<p>
<ol>
  <li><div>
  <p><strong>The anatomy of the hungarian adventist schisms and the abortive attempts of
reconnection</strong></p>
  <p>With their communist background, the 3 major schisms show us a unique pattern. What are the
recurring patterns? Could similar phenomena happen with different political backgrounds? What can
we learn from the past?</p>
</div></li> 
  
  <li><div>
  <p><strong>The psychology of reunion</strong></p>
  <p>Understanding the method of the research lays the foundation for the authenticity of the results.
How can we expand a sentiment of 30 people to that many person? After 8 unsuccessful trial to
reconnect, what circumstances helped the process of 2015? The patterns of reunion, according to
the analysis of 3 focus group.</p>
</div></li>  

  <li><div>
  <p><strong>William Bridges’ Transition Model and the process of integration</strong></p>
  <p>The results and lessons of the study. Is there a surprise to what we see from the outside or
experience from the inside? How can we use these lessons?</p>
</div></li>  

  <li><div>
  <p><strong>Theological reflections on the biblical bases of reunion</strong></p>
  <p>History is not written by us. 2000 years ago the millennial dividing wall between the Jews and
Gentiles was destroyed. What happened at that time? How can we apply these things today? What
would happen if we followed the biblical way? What are the dividing walls within the church today?
Is there any hope for true unity? Or do we chase shadows?</p>
</div></li>  
</ol>
</p>

<p>What are the leadership challenges of the reunion? The concluding, relevant lessons of the study.</p>
